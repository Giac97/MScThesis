Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of condensed matter, complementing and reinforcing both experiment and theory. Simulations provide detailed information about structure and dynamics, essential to understand the many fluid systems that play a key role in our daily lives: polymers, gels, colloidal suspensions, liquid crystals, biological membranes, and glasses. The second edition of this pioneering book aims to explain how simulation programs work, how to use them, and how to interpret the results, with examples of the latest research in this rapidly evolving field. Accompanying programs in Fortran and Python provide practical, hands-on, illustrations of the ideas in the text.},

Predicting their morphology and mechanical properties beyond a trial-and-error approach is a crucial issue limiting their exploitation in real-life applications. The morphology and mechanical properties of Ag nanoparticle ultrathin films, synthesized by supersonic cluster beam deposition, are here assessed adopting a bottom-up, multitechnique approach. A virtual film model is proposed merging high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, supersonic cluster beam dynamics, and molecular dynamics simulations. The model is validated against mechanical nanometrology measurements and is readily extendable to metals other than Ag. The virtual film is shown to be a flexible and reliable predictive tool to access morphology-dependent properties such as mesoscale gas-dynamics and elasticity of ultrathin films synthesized by gas-phase deposition.},

We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100), (110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100), (110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture. We emphasize problems with hydrogen and with surfaces because none of these can be treated with pair potentials.

They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision.

We present 12-6 and 9-6 LJ parameters for several face-centered cubic metals (Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt) which reproduce densities, surface tensions, interface properties with water and (bio)organic molecules, as well as mechanical properties in quantitative (<0.1%) to good qualitative (25%) agreement with experiment under ambient conditions. Deviations associated with earlier LJ models have been reduced by 1 order of magnitude due to the precise fit of the new models to densities and surface tensions under standard conditions, which also leads to significantly improved results for surface energy anisotropics, interface tensions, and mechanical properties. The performance is comparable to tight-binding and embedded atom models at up to a million times lower computational cost. The models extend classical simulation methods to metals and a variety of interfaces with biopolymers, surfactants, and other nanostructured materials through compatibility with widely used force fields, including AMBER, CHARMM, COMPASS, CVFF, OPLS-AA, and PCFF. Limitations include the neglect of electronic structure effects and the restriction to noncovalent interactions with the metals. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Atomic clusters, consisting of a few to a few thousand atoms, have emerged over the past 40 years as the ultimate nanoparticles, whose structure and properties can be controlled one atom at a time. One of the early motivations in studying clusters was to understand how the properties of matter evolve as a function of size, shape, and composition. Over the past few decades, more than 200 000 papers have been published in this field. These studies have not only led to a considerable understanding of this evolution from clusters to crystals, but also have revealed many unusual size-specific properties that make cluster science an interdisciplinary field on its own, bridging physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, and medicine. More importantly, the possibility of creating a new class of materials, composed of clusters instead of atoms as building blocks, has fueled the hope that one can synthesize materials from the bottom-up with unique and tailored properties. This Review focuses on the properties that set clusters apart from their corresponding bulk. Furthermore, this Review describes how different electron-counting rules can lead to the design of stable clusters, mimicking the chemistry of atoms. We highlight the potential of these "superatoms" as building blocks of cluster-assembled materials. Specifically, we emphasize cluster-inspired materials for energy applications. The concluding section includes a summary of the salient features of clusters, potential challenges that remain, and an outlook for the future of cluster science.},

Correctly estimating their electrical conductivity is crucial, but, particularly for the latter regime, standard theoretical tools are not quite adequate. We therefore developed a procedure based on an atomically informed mesoscopic model in which ab initio estimates of electronic transport at the nanoscale are used to reconstruct the conductivity of nanogranular gold films generated by molecular dynamics. An equivalent resistor network is developed, appropriately accounting for ballistic transport. The method is shown to correctly capture the nonmonotonic behavior of the conductivity as a function of the film thickness, namely, a signature feature of nanogranular films.},

Thanks to their unique features, ultralow density materials-known as nanofoams-are attracting a growing interest for many cutting-edge applications. PLD has emerged as one of the most promising and versatile techniques for the synthesis of nanofoam; however, the lack of a satisfactory comprehension of the nanofoam growth process hinders the unleashing of their full potential as innovative materials. In this work we propose a snowfall-like model that describes the nanofoam growth as the coalescence of micrometric-sized fractal aggregates of nanoparticles, where the aggregates are formed through an in-flight process whose timescale is determined by the shot-to-shot time interval. We exploit these insights to demonstrate an approach to control the nanofoam properties down to the nanoscale. These results, along with their interest from a fundamental point of view, open perspectives in the field of low density nanostructured materials.},

   abstract = {In many processes of interest in physics, chemistry and biology small particles come together to form large structures. Very often these structures have a disorderly nature that can be described quite well in terms of the concepts of fractal geometry. The fractal geometry of small particle aggregates plays an important role in their physical behavior including the kinetics of the aggregation process itself. In many cases the kinetics of aggregation can be described by a mean field Smoluchowski equation. The geometric scaling properties (fractal geometry) of the aggregating clusters determine the scaling symmetry of the reaction kernel which in turn determines the asymptotic form of the cluster size distribution and the growth of the mean cluster size. In most simple systems the asymptotic cluster size distribution can be described by the scaling form (Formula Presented.) where Ns(t) is the number of clusters of size s at time t and S(t) is the mean cluster size at time t. This scaling form is superuniversal and can be used in circumstances where the mean field Smoluchowski equation does not provide an adequate representation of the aggregation kinetics. This scaling form also describes the aggregation kinetics for non-fractal systems such as the coalescence of particles and droplets. In this review recent advances in the application of fractal geometry and simple scaling ideas to aggregation, coalescence and fragmentation processes are described. © 1992 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Unexpectedly, in the last decade, several studies showed that nanogranular metallic films show a non-linear electric behavior, substantially different from their polycrystalline counterparts. Here we review and discuss the electrical transport properties of cluster-assembled films. Our aim is to provide a background and a common language for the systematic investigation and exploitation of nanogranular metallic thin films where the extremely high density of defects and grain boundaries causes the departure from ohmic behavior.
